    <p>"Tokyo Korb 2049" was a small scrolling-shooter game I developed during my 2nd year of college.</p>

    <p>Everything in the game was developed/created by myself other than the dog sprite (Credit to Toby Fox) and the music.</p>

        The game was developed during a funny period of my technological advancement, I was beginning to grasp object oriented design and game engines better
        but had to finish this game on time for school, so stuck with the primitive <i>GameMaker</i> in which everything was a pain to do, but was doable if you
        constantly did hacky workarounds.

    <p>
        Because of this the programming aspect of this project was not terribly enjoyable, while I did stretch GameMaker to it's limits in some places, the most
        enjoyable aspects of the project were the game design, art and sounds which all togther made the game actually end up pretty fun and looking/sounding
        pretty good too (in my opinion)!.

    <p>My personal favourite parts of the game are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Super Metroid <s>rip off</s> homage at the start of the game.</li>
        <li>Watching the art I spent so long designing and making scroll by in a parralax manner in the background.</li>
        <li>The mini-dog powerup, it's just so cute! <img src="~/img/portfolio/tokyokorb2049/puppy.gif" /></li>
        <li>
            The final boss fight, I spent so damn long on this boss fight, it's code is absolute spaghetti thanks to GameMaker
            but I super enjoyed designing the fight and the boss.
        </li>
    </ul>
